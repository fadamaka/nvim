# NeoVim Config for Win 11 with Lazy

Pull the project into `~/AppData/Local/` and press `SHIFT + i` on the first startup when Lazy UI pops up.

Probably you are going to need dependencies such as:
 - NeoVim (obviously)
 - Python
 - Node js
 - gcc
 - Fonts with Powerline characters (latest Win 11 Cascadia Mono seem to have that)
 - git
